    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This sambusa recipe is my version of a Somali dish that I learned by watching friends around Ramadan. These sambusas are really good, and I can't stop eating them. They are served during Ramadan, weddings, parties, or just because. Since I am married to a Somalian man, I learned to cook a few things, and there are some of my American dishes he loves as well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 leek, chopped</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">2 teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 (14 ounce) package spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li class="IngredientsBox">1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="StepsBox">
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, leek, and garlic in hot oil until onion is transparent. Add ground beef; cook and stir until still slightly pink and about halfway done. Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper; mix well. Continue cooking until beef is browned and crumbly. Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>Mix together flour and water in a small bowl to make a thin paste. Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone. Fill cone with beef mixture, close the top, and seal with paste. Repeat until wrappers or filling are used up.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). There should be enough oil to submerge sambusas. Fry sambusas, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
