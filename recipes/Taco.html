    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Birria tacos are so delicious and this recipe is my take on the world's most trendy taco. Seriously, when you make these, you'll understand what all the fuss is about. Start with a batch of my beef birria and use some of the sauce in these shredded beef tacos with cheese. A super savory, aromatic consommé is served on the side for dipping.</p>
