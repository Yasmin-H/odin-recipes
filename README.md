<p> My first task in the Odin Project was to create a basic recipe website which will consist of a main index page that will aslo have links to a few recipes 

<p> The main objective of this task was to recap on my basic HTML and CSS skills :) <p>




### Reflection:

<p> It was nice to go back to coding again after a long break. Not only was it nice way to recap everything that I knew but I also managed to consolidate my knowledge on Block and Inline. This concept was one of the few topics I glossed over at the beginning of my coding journey and therefore when I had to work on big projects, I struggled sometimes with placing boxes at the right places or getting them to be in a row rather than stacked on top of each other. Very happy that I know now what to do next time !  <p>
